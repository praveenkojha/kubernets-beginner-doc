                          Labels & Selectors

Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to Kubernetes.
They are used as identifying attributes for objects such as pods and replication controller

Selectors:
They are used by the users to select a set of objects.

example:
1. If you have pod running with name- nginx-8glqx

2. for your convience you can label the pod as: 

command:
--->kubecl label pod nginx-8glqx nginx=test  --overwrite

3. if you want to find more details about label, then you can use:
command:
-- kubectl describe pod -l  nginx=test

@master:~/kub-test-folder# kubectl describe deployment -l app=nginx
